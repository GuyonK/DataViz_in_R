# Training and testing data 

In this course we use the same open data for training and evaluation purposes:

Number of deaths in the population of the Netherlands by main underlying cause of death, by age and sex, 1996-2022

https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=en&_catalog=CBS&tableId=7233ENG&_theme=1120


Identifier:	7233ENG

```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/TestingData_Project.png')
```

#Assignment

Made two different visualizations using ggplot2 using testing data:

- specify at least 5 out of 7 grammar of graphics' layers for each visualization

- make them knowledgeable (so that you can make a right conclusion looking at the plot) 

- present them with a short description in .Rmd and .pdf format

- upload two files (.Rmd and .pdf) to the Brightspace. Alternatively, you can also submit .R and .pdf if you have difficulties with Rmarkdown.

#How to generate .pdf from .Rmd

You can use this code:
```{r pdf, eval = FALSE}
library(renderthis)
library(pdftools)

to_pdf("Project.Rmd")
```

or you can adjust the YAML metadata in your .Rmd file:

```{r YAML, eval = FALSE}
