2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Definitions:,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Underlying (formerly called: primary) cause of death,,,,,,,,,
The causes of death used in this table are the 'three digit codes' according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health (ICD10, 10th revision) of the World Health Organization.,,,,,,,,
WHO defines an underlying cause of death as: (a) the disease or disorder that initiates the causal chain of diseases or disorders leading directly to death (natural death); (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence causing the injury that initiated the causal chain of morbid events leading directly to death (non-natural death).,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Death due to COVID-19,,,,,,,,,
In order to properly map the mortality due to COVID-19 for statistical purposes, death due to COVID-19 is defined as death due to a clinically compatible disease, in case of confirmed or suspected/probable COVID-19, unless there is a clear other cause of death that can not be related to COVID-19 (e.g. injury or accident). There can not be a period of full recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. ,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Classification and coding of COVID-19 for de Mortality statistics according to the WHO guidelines:,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, virus identified COVID-19 NOS - confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 - when COVID-19 has been confirmed by laboratory testing and clinical signs or symptoms.,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, suspected or probable COVID-19 - clinical or epidemiological diagnosis (suspected or probable) of COVID-19 but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Deaths,,,,,,,,,
The figures refer to the deaths of the Dutch resident population, i.e. persons included in municipal population registers (in the Netherlands: the Key Register of Persons (BRP)).,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Age ,,,,,,,,,
Age at time of death.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Explanation of symbols:,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"Empty cell	: figure not applicable",,,,,,,,,
". 		: figure is unknown", insufficiently reliable or confidential,,,,,,,,
