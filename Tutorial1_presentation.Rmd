There are many platform for data vizualization. For sure, you are aware of at least one of them, Microsoft Excel or its analogs. However, there are many powerful data vizualization tools that allow scientists to communicate their findings more effectively. Like MatPlotLib and Seaborn Python libraries. This course is about one of such powerful systems made for R programming scientific community. It is ggplot2.

The *grammar of graphics* is a plotting framework developed by Leland Wilkinson (Grammar of Graphics, 1999) that dissects each component of a graph into individual layer. 

There are two important principles:

- Graphics are made of distinct layers of grammatical elements

- Plots are built with appropriate aesthetic mappings to make these plots meaningful

Three out of 7 layers are essential for any plot:

**Data** This is the dataset being plotted containing the variables to be plotted on the graph.

**Aesthetics**	Aesthetics refers to the scales on which we map the data. Some common aesthetics to consider are axis, shape, size, and color.

**Geometries**	Geom refers to the actual visual elements used for the data in the plot, such as points, lines, and bars.

Cleaning and reading in your data is one of the least immediately satisfying pieces of an analysis. Fortunately, many of you already know how to manage data in R if you are taking Mandy Velthuis course on the data management in R. In this small course we will use preprocessed data. 

But we still need to load the data into R, so we'll discuss this step.

The code you see on the slide load the data downloaded from CBS Open data using read_csv() function from tidyverse package.


The resulting message gives some information about the loaded file. Like the size. It also names the columns and tells us that the read_csv() function has assigned a class to each of the columns of the object it created from the CSV file. 


You can look at the loaded table via "Environment" tab

How do you think, is it a clean data? Can we work further with it?
One can find the meaning for all these identification in 7233ENG_metadata.csv file from CBS

Since the goal of this course is not to teach you all about R, but just how to produce good graphics, we can ignore many details, before they start interfering with you vizualizations of course. 

But we need to polish the data, so it is more easily readable on the plots

#Histogram: two variables

It is possible to represent the distribution of *several variables* on the same axis using this technique.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r histogram two variables, eval = FALSE}
Death_in_NL %>%
  filter(Age == "Total")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Deaths, fill = Sex))+
    geom_histogram(color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.5, position="identity", binwidth = 800)+
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#69b3a2", "#404080"))
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{r histogram two variables, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6} 
```

#Density plot
In a density plot, we attempt to visualize the underlying probability distribution of the data by drawing an appropriate continuous curve estimated from the data. The most commonly used method for this estimation procedure is called kernel density estimation.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
``` {r density plot, eval = FALSE}
Death_in_NL %>% 
  filter(Age == "Total") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Deaths, fill = Sex))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)+
  ggtitle("Smoothed density estimate")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{r density plot, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6} 
```

#Basic Boxplot

A boxplot divides the data into quartiles and visualizes them in a standardized manner. You need to specify *a quantitative variable* for the Y axis, and *a qualitative variable* for the X axis (a group).

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r boxplot basic, eval = FALSE} 
Death_in_NL %>%
  filter(Age != "Total", CausesOfDeath == "Neoplasms")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Deaths))+
    geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5) #<<
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]

.right-column[
```{r boxplot basic, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5} 
```

#A grouped boxplot

Here we visualize the distribution of 21 groups (Age intervals) and 2 subgroups (Male and Female). The group must be called in the X argument of ggplot2. The subgroup is called in the fill or color argument.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r grouped boxplot, eval = FALSE} 
Death_in_NL %>%
  filter(Age != "Total", CausesOfDeath == "Neoplasms")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Deaths, fill = Sex))+
    geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5) #<<
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{r grouped boxplot, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5} 
```

#Boxplot with individual data points

A boxplot summarizes the distribution of a continuous variable. It is often criticized for hiding the underlying data. Therefore, showing individual observations using jitter on top of boxes is a good practice.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r grouped boxplot jitter, eval = FALSE} 
Death_in_NL %>%
  filter(Age != "Total", CausesOfDeath == "Neoplasms")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Deaths))+
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Sex), alpha=0.5)+ #<<
    geom_jitter(color="black", size=0.5, alpha=0.9) #<<
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{r grouped boxplot jitter, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5} 
```
]
]

#Violin plot

Violin plot is really close from a boxplot, but allows a deeper understanding of the distribution. Violins are particularly adapted when the amount of data is huge and showing individual observations gets impossible.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r violin plot, eval = FALSE} 
Death_in_NL %>%
  filter(Age == "Total")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sex,  y = Deaths))+
    geom_violin(aes(fill = Sex)) #<<
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{r violin plot, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5} 
```

#Your turn

1. Plot 1 from slide 14 demonstrates distributions in the number of deceased per year over the period from 1996 to 2021. And a dot plot is not the best geom to demonstrate distributions. Modify the plot using the geoms that fit better for the task (see lecture 1_5_geometries).

2. The plot from slide 17 looks good enough, although the amounts for many lines are not recognizable. Can you visualize the number of deceased from different causes of death for a particular year (2015).

3. The plot on slide 26 shows the progression in the number of deceased over time. It uses the total number of deceased, irrespective of their age. Make a new plot to visualize the number of deceased men and women depending on their age; make it for a particular year (2015) and for a particular cause of death (neoplasms).
